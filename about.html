    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there! I'm Blxze, and here's a bit about me:</p>
    <p>I manage "/Jujutsu", a Discord server where we chat.</p>
    <p>At 15, I'm into coding and gaming. It's something I enjoy.</p>
    <p>But besides that, I also prioritize staying fit. Hitting the gym is a regular thing for me.</p>
    <p>When it comes to food, I enjoy spicy dishes, and basketball is a sport I like to play in my free time.</p>
    <p>I also do editing work and, of course, programming. Always exploring and learning new things.</p>
    <p>Did you know I run a bot on Discord called "Choso"?</p>
    <p>I tend to take things more seriously than others.</p>
    <p>I'm not into drama or K-pop songs, I like hip-hop more.</p>
    <p>I have a dog, her name is Jessie.</p>
    <p>I'm into older women.</p>
